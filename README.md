# 🎮 Pacman Search Agents - Intro to AI Concepts

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence - Pacman Search Agents** project! Here, your Pacman agent will navigate maze worlds, finding paths to reach specific goals and collecting food along the way. You’ll develop and apply general search algorithms like depth-first, breadth-first, and A* to solve these classic AI challenges.

## 📂 Project Highlights

- **Pathfinding**: Guide Pacman through mazes to reach target locations efficiently.
- **Food Collection** 🍒: Implement strategies to help Pacman gather food while avoiding dead-ends.
- **Search Algorithms** 🔍: Build and apply algorithms that make Pacman smarter, teaching him to tackle both simple and complex scenarios.

Whether you’re just starting out with AI or brushing up on search algorithms, this project offers a fun, hands-on approach to learning foundational AI techniques. Good luck helping Pacman outsmart those tricky mazes!
